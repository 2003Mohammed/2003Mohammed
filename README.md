HEY THERE !!!

I’m Mohammed, a Cloud and DevOps Engineer focused on building stable and automated infrastructure. 


My core expertise lies in the AWS ecosystem. While I am Azure Certified (AZ-500) and have a strong foundation in cloud security, I spend most of my time working with Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins to keep systems running smoothly.





I’ve built several projects to explore these technologies, but my favorite is Algo Viz. It’s a free visual learning tool for data structures and algorithms that I built to help students grasp complex logic more easily—something I’m quite passionate about as a recent graduate.





Unique Fun Facts:

I’m an Azure Security Engineer who ironically spends most of my time in an AWS console while using cloud.


I believe the best code is the code I don’t have to manage.


I’m a firm believer that "Infrastructure as Code" is the only way to sleep peacefully at night.

Favorite Hobbies:

Chess: I enjoy the strategic depth and calculating a few moves ahead.

Exploring History: I find it fascinating to see how past events shaped our current world🧑‍🏫.

Learning Tech: I'm always looking into the next tool or practice that can optimize a pipeline.

Sleeping: Essential for a well-rested brain 🥱😂.
